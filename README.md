# Getting Started 

From the root of your Hugo site, clone the theme into `themes/cocoa` by running:

git clone https://github.com/nishanths/cocoa-hugo-theme.git themes/cocoa
````

Then, generate your site's files by running:

````
hugo -t cocoa
````

# Usage

This section describes how to create content that works well with this theme.

## Example site

An example site is available under the `exampleSite/` directory. 

## Creating Content

* Posts should go under a `content/posts` directory. Typically you would run:

````
hugo new posts/new-post.md
````

* Fixed pages such as an About page should preferably go under a `content/fixed` or be present at the root of the `contents` directory.

````
$ hugo new fixed/about.md
````

## Site variables

Please see the sample `config.toml` under the `exampleSite/` directory.

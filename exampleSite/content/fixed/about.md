I'm a software engineer and student at UT Austin. I primarily program in JavaScript. I currently work at Evernote. I also teach a web development class as part of <a href="//cs.utexas.edu/users/mad">MAD</a>, a computer science campus organization.

I love soccer and mediterranean food. You can find recent open source work on <a target="_blank" href="//github.com/nishanths">GitHub</a>.
